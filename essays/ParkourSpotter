This paper focuses on the development of a mobile application tailored for the parkour community, designed to facilitate the discovery, rating, and sharing of parkour spots while optimising parkour workout routes. Addressing a notable gap in specialised tools for parkour practitioners, the app integrates user-generated content with geographic information to provide an interactive platform. The project’s objectives included leveraging Swift and Xcode to create a user-friendly interface, developing a route optimisation algorithm, and employing a mapping Application Programming Interface (API) to visualise parkour locations. Through extensive research, design, and development phases, the application successfully provides a valuable tool for the community, enhancing engagement and growth. Challenges encountered and learning from them are discussed, along with potential future enhancements to develop the app’s functionality and user experience.
