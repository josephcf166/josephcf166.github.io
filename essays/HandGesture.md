This paper details the development of a system for detecting hand gestures using video inputs, aiming to assist individuals with difficulties using standard input devices and to enhance interaction in various situations. It explores the effectiveness of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) in computer vision, addressing the challenges of training with unbiased data. The study concludes with potential future directions, including adopting more complex models like Darknet53 for improved performance.
