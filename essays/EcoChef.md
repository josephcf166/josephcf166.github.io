This paper introduces EcoChef, a mobile application aimed at reducing food waste by suggesting recipes based on ingredients users already have at home. By focusing on an eco-friendly approach, EcoChef addresses the issue of food waste, particularly household waste, which is a significant contributor to the overall waste problem. The app targets users who wish to utilise leftover ingredients efficiently, offering a solution that adapts recipe suggestions to the user's available ingredients. The development process, including initial research, functional and non-functional requirements, UI design, and wireframes, is detailed. Feedback from potential users has led to revisions in functional requirements and the design of mock-ups for a more user-friendly experience. EcoChef's design follows Material Design guidelines, ensuring an intuitive and efficient user interface.
